## Using the Dataset

Now that the dataset is pre-built, we can use it. The dataset can be used directly (not through the PyTorch
Dataset format) for several applications. Here, we highlight two:

1. Dataset exploration & visualization.
2. Building task dataframes for fine-tuning. In this step, we'll also show how to craft zero-shot labelers,
   though this doesn't really rely on the dataset class.
